#In this SQL I am working with multiple tables to quantify statistics on Customers and orders made.  

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

select count(OrderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
    where length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

select count(OrderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
    where length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID'
    and product= 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum

select distinct Customers.acctnum from Customers
    inner join FebSales
    on Customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
    where length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

select distinct Product, Price from BIT_DB.JanSales
    where length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID'
    and price <= (select min(price)
     from BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select distinct Product, Sum(quantity) * price as revenue from BIT_DB.JanSales
    where length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID'
    order by revenue desc;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select Product,sum(quantity), price, sum(quantity) * price as revenue from BIT_DB.FebSales
   where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
   group by product
   order by revenue desc;
      
#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

  select count(distinct customers.acctnum) as 'Customer Count',avg(FebSales.quantity*FebSales.price) as 'Avg Spent'
    From BIT_DB.FebSales
    left join BIT_DB.Customers
    on FebSales.orderid= Customers.order_ID
    where FebSales.Quantity >2
    and length (orderid)=6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID';
